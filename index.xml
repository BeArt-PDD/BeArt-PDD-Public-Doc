      <description>Throughout history, as people immerse themselves in the real world, much of what they see and hear often fades with time. Yet, there are certain things that withstand the test of time, such as the truths of humanity, the laws of nature, the cycles of life and death. When it comes to the question of eternity, opinions vary.&#xA;Perhaps in the river of civilization, there truly is no eternal existence beyond the material world.</description>

      <description>BeArt is a platform specializing in the issuance and trading of high-value art-related RWA (Real World Asset) and WEB3 encrypted assets globally.&#xA;Through the integration of technology and financial innovation, BeArt has mapped real-world art assets into the crypto domain. With proprietary detection technology patents, BeArt introduces RWA assets that resemble NFTs but are based on protocols similar to ERC721 and ERC1155, along with associated derivative assets known as RWAD.</description>

      <title>ERC721g</title>
      <link>https://BeArt-PDD.github.io/docs/erc721g/</link>

      <description>Building upon the foundation of ERC721, BeArt introduces the ERC721g standard, incorporating additional fixed module tags focused on supporting art-related RWA (Real World Asset) assets. This standard enhances support for pre-recorded data functions and increased expansion of information. The modules include:&#xA;Collector Information Tag: Provides detailed personal or institutional information about the art owner&#xA;Collection Details: Includes basic information about the artwork such as name, creator, creation year, material, and any special historical or narrative aspects.</description>

      <title>RWA Asset Standard</title>
      <link>https://BeArt-PDD.github.io/docs/standard/</link>

      <description>The RWA asset standard promoted by BeArt adopts a range of advanced techniques, including optical scanning, image recognition, 3D modeling, photogrammetry, and detailed material and color analysis. These technologies work together to create an accurate, micron-level genetic image and dataset that not only records basic artwork sequences but also provides a detailed display of its three-dimensional structure.&#xA;Moreover, this standard emphasizes the security and verifiability of data collection. By using encrypted and verifiable scientific equipment and combining it with professional researchers&amp;rsquo; operations, this standard achieves end-to-end encrypted communication from offline data collection to on-chain smart contract records, ensuring data authenticity and integrity.</description>

      <title>CATALOGUE System</title>
      <link>https://BeArt-PDD.github.io/docs/system/</link>

      <guid>https://BeArt-PDD.github.io/docs/system/</guid>
      <description>The CATALOGUE System introduced by BeArt represents a patented technology focused on achieving a 100% genuine on-chain mapping of art RWA assets, akin to a &amp;ldquo;minting system&amp;rdquo; for artistic assets. The CATALOGUE System comprises two fundamental functionalities: &amp;ldquo;Certification&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Art Gene Card.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Certification: This involves a blockchain-based system combined with interdisciplinary science to provide identity authentication and authenticity verification for artworks.&#xA;Art Gene Card: This is the data credential and visual representation result of the CATALOGUE System, presenting a unique identification RWA asset gene card (archive).</description>

      <title>Explanation</title>
      <link>https://BeArt-PDD.github.io/docs/explanation/</link>

      <guid>https://BeArt-PDD.github.io/docs/explanation/</guid>
      <description>Due to BeArt&amp;rsquo;s introduction of RWA assets, which not only encompass an economic and interactive financial system akin to NFT projects but also incorporate various traditional auction industry businesses, we are combining a traditional business model with a blockchain financial system to drive the overall development and expansion of the platform.&#xA;BeArt is committed to providing a diversified platform for art trading and exhibitions while serving as an ecological economic entity.</description>

      <title>RWA Asset</title>
      <link>https://BeArt-PDD.github.io/docs/asset/</link>

      <description>After each piece of artwork is mapped through the CATALOGUE System, it will circulate on the blockchain in the form of RWA assets. Similar to the artwork itself, RWAs possess unique attributes and are uniquely tied to high-value artworks. Transaction earnings generated by each physical artwork will be distributed as profit-sharing rights to the corresponding RWA asset holders.&#xA;Buyers can conveniently purchase/sell the RWA assets associated with the artwork online at any time, representing a transaction or transfer of ownership of the artwork itself.</description>

      <description>Governance rights for BeArt Token will be reflected in the following aspects:&#xA;BeArt holders can obtain gBeArt by staking, which will be used for platform voting and governance. The longer users stake BeArt Tokens, the higher their voting weight with gBeArt. gBeArt holders will have the right to participate in proposals and decisions related to the future development of the BeArt ecosystem. gBeArt holders will receive rewards from the governance treasury based on their level of participation in various proposals.</description>

The distribution of BeArt Tokens is divided into three main categories:&#xA;Community Ecosystem Incentives: Used for various incentives in BeArt community ecosystem development, including Ecosystem Mining Pools (MP), Public Offerings (PO), and Strategic Investments (Investment), aiming to reward all participants in ecosystem development roles. Project Operations (OC): Mainly for the initial development of the project, including research and development, product development, operations, marketing, and community management.</description>

      <guid>https://BeArt-PDD.github.io/docs/mechanism/</guid>
      <description>BeArt adopts the BBTE (Behavior-Based Token Economics) mechanism, which aims to quantify and recognize users&amp;rsquo; positive contributions on the BeArt platform by rewarding these behaviors. This mechanism is expected to be fully operational after the Token&amp;rsquo;s official launch.&#xA;Depending on the different roles, users can receive varying types and amounts of rewards.&#xA;BeArt&amp;rsquo;s rewards mainly consist of three categories: BeArt Level Achievement System; BeArt Credits Credit Rating System; BeArt Token Ecological Rewards.</description>

      <guid>https://BeArt-PDD.github.io/docs/auction/</guid>
      <description>The bidding function is one of the core features of BeArt. We have initially adopted an improved &amp;ldquo;English auction&amp;rdquo; to better align with the process and characteristics of online auctions, while also providing buyers with the option for &amp;ldquo;fixed-price&amp;rdquo; purchases (which also serves as a fixed-price selling feature for sellers).</description>

      <title>RWA Collection</title>
      <link>https://BeArt-PDD.github.io/docs/collection/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://BeArt-PDD.github.io/docs/collection/</guid>
      <description>The RWA Collection is the core feature and first Art RWA product of BeArt Bank. Unlike protocols like Fraction.art for NFT fractionalization, RWA Collection is an on-chain asset that grants complete physical ownership. Users can simultaneously own both on-chain art assets and real-world physical assets, achieved through a series of on-chain supervision and binding, along with offline authentication and delivery. This process results in the digitization of physical assets on the blockchain, enabling a range of financial innovations, enhancing liquidity in the art market, and optimizing art pricing rationality.</description>
